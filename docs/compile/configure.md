Please refer to ./common/autoconf/generated-configure.sh

Then please refer to how we hand "with_concolic" 

0. xxx.m4 (not used, but it seems that this is where every configuration from)

1. generated-configure.sh (although this is a generated file, we use this to configure macros)

2. modify spec.gmk
